/**
 * JavaScript is a programming language initially designed to interact with elements of web pages. In web browsers, JavaScript consists of three main parts:

    ECMAScript that provides the core functionality.
    The Document Object Model (DOM), which provides interfaces for interacting with elements on web pages
    The Browser Object Model (BOM), which provides API for interacting with web browsers.
    JavaScript allows you to add interactivity to a web page. It is often used with HTML and CSS to enhance the 
    functionality of a web page such as validating forms, creating interactive maps, and displaying animated charts.

    When a web page is loaded i.e. after HTML and CSS have been downloaded, the JavaScript engine in the web browser 
    executes the JavaScript code. The JavaScript code then modifies the HTML and CSS to dynamically update the user 
    interface.

    Client-side vs. Server-side JavaScript
    When JavaScript is used on a web page, it is executed in the web browsers of user’s computers. In this case, 
    JavaScript works as a client-side language.

    JavaScript can run on both web browsers and servers. A popular server-side environment for JavaScript is Node.js. 
    Unlike the client-side JavaScript, the server-side JavaScript executes on the server that allows you to access 
    databases, file systems, etc.
